Focussing on Swift 3.1 and simple application development life cycle

## Playgrounds
With the update of Swift 3.1 I wanted to explore the language design and features and explore them using Xcode Playgrounds. As a modern language I enjoyed comparing it to Python and Java and C, and appreciating the major features of this new and exciting language.

## Stanford iOS 10 Development 
Following the lectures and walkthroughs from the iTunes U Stanford program, I learn about the MVC design model, using Xcode to design interfaces adhering to good HCI guidelines, as well as key features of iOS development such as Cocoa Touch, Multithreading, Core Graphics and more. 

## Other projects
Worked alongside Apple tutorials for iOS application development, simple apps help to understand the basic MVC principle as well as common development lifecycle methods and practices.
